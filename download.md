General comment on Cilialyzer releases: 
Please note that the Cilialyzer is currently undergoing further development. 
Unfortunately, the software still crashes occasionally. We will take care of these (in)stability problems in the next few weeks and release a considerably more stable version
by the beginning of 2024. 
Furthermore, it is important to note that we have the impression that running Cilialyzer by executing the compiled binary release for Windows is unfortunately the least stable variant of 
using Cilialyzer. 
We recommend to run the Cilialyzer from the Python environment. However, the clearly most stable variant of using Cilialyzer 
is to run it within the Python environment installed on a machine running Ubuntu Linux.  

Should you encounter any technical problems, should you be interested in collaborating, or should you simply like to give us a feedback, you are very welcome to contact us by e-mail: 
martin.schneiter@unibe.ch. 
We would be happy to keep our users up-to-date and notify them by e-mail as soon as a new version of Cilialyzer has been made available. 
And we would like to learn more about who is using our software for what purpose. 
We would therefore very appreciate to receive a short notification by e-mail to the above address.
