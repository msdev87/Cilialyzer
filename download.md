<b>General comment on Cilialyzer releases:</b>  <br />
Please note that the Cilialyzer is currently undergoing further development. 
Unfortunately, the software still crashes occasionally. We will take care of these (in)stability problems in the next few weeks and release a considerably more stable version
by the beginning of 2024. 
Furthermore, it is important to note that we have the impression that running Cilialyzer by executing the compiled binary release for Windows is unfortunately the least stable variant of 
using Cilialyzer. 
We recommend to run the Cilialyzer from the Python environment. However, the clearly most stable variant of using Cilialyzer 
is to run it within the Python environment installed on a machine running Ubuntu Linux.  

Should you encounter any technical problems, should you be interested in collaborating, or should you simply like to give us a feedback, you are very welcome to contact us by e-mail: 
martin.schneiter@gmx.ch. 
We would be happy to keep our users up-to-date and notify them by e-mail as soon as a new version of Cilialyzer has been made available. 
And finally, we would also like to learn more about who is using our software for what purpose. 
We would therefore very much appreciate to receive your short notification by e-mail to the above address.

<b>List of most important changes made to version 1.2.0:</b>  <br />

<b> Acitivity map:</b>  <br />
The calculation of the activity map has been heavily revised. 
The current calculation correlates now well with our visual assessment of the proportion of active cilia. 
We will provide here a link to a report of the newly implemented algorithm. 

<b> Pixel Binning: </b>  <br />
A 'Pixel Binning' button has been added to the ROI-selection tab. If pressed, a 2x2 pixel binning (cubic interpolation) is performed. 
Please note that it may make sense to perform a pixel binning, as many calculations are time-consuming and/or memory-intensive. 

<b> Image stabilization: </b>  <br />
In most cases it should no longer be necessary to manually crop the video after performing an image stabilization, as the video gets now cropped automatically after having been stabilized. 

<b> ROI-selection: </b>  <br />
A region of interest can now be selected repeatedly. 

<b> Image rotation: </b>  <br />
Bug considering the image rotation has now been solved. (After having been rotated, the video does now actually remain rotated.)
