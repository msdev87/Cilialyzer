**Dear visitor**,


we are currently in the process of finalizing a **greatly improved version of Cilialyzer**.  
If you would like to receive a link to download the newest Cilialyzer version -- **still free, open source and running out of the box (binary version)** -- please notify us via email:
[martin.schneiter@unibe.ch](mailto:martin.schneiter@unibe.ch). 


By doing so, you will help us to get to know our user base better. Additionally, all of our registered users will in future get notified 
as soon as the latest stable Cilialyzer version is available (approximately 2--3 times per year). 
In your mail, we would very much appreciate, if you could provide brief information for what purposes you plan to use Cilialyzer.


Thank you for your support and we are looking forward to hearing from you. 


Best wishes,  
Martin Schneiter, PhD
