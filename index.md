**Dear visitor**,


we are currently in the process of finalizing a **greatly improved version of Cilialyzer**.  
If you would like to receive a link to download the newest Cilialyzer version, please notify us via email:  
**[martin.schneiter@unibe.ch](mailto:martin.schneiter@unibe.ch)**.  
The greatly improved upcoming version will still be **free, open source and the compiled/binary version runs out of the box**.

By your notification via mail, you help us to get to know our user base. All of our users will be registered and getting notified 
as soon as a new stable Cilialyzer version will be available (approximately 2--3 times per year). 
In your mail, we would very much appreciate, if you could provide brief information for what purpose you plan to use Cilialyzer.


Thank you for your support and we are looking forward to hearing from you. 


Best wishes,  
Martin Schneiter, PhD
